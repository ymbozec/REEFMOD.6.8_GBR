% Allometric relationship based on Hall and Hughes 1996:
% Egg volume = exp(a+b*log(size))

% all_egg_volumes = exp(a + b*log(adult_relfitness.*adult_coral_sizes)) ; % mm3 of eggs produced by each colony
% Correction 29/09/2022: logs in Hall&Hughes were log10, not natural logs!!
% Also, makes more sense to apply relative fitness on number of eggs rather than colony size (log...)
all_egg_volumes = adult_relfitness.*(10.^(a + b*log10(adult_coral_sizes))) ; % mm3 of eggs produced by each colony

fecundity = floor(sum(sum(all_egg_volumes))/0.1) ; %0.1 mm3 is the average volume of an egg
